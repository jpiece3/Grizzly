## Tips & Best Practices

### Route Generation
- Assign days to all your delivery stops BEFORE generating routes
- Generate routes for one day at a time for better control
- The system automatically optimizes route order to minimize driving time

### Scheduling Stops
- Use the filter cards to quickly see what's scheduled for each day
- The orange "Unscheduled" banner helps you find stops that need days assigned
- One stop can appear on multiple days (for recurring deliveries)

### Managing Drivers
- Create driver accounts before assigning routes
- Each driver should have a unique username
- Drivers can only see their own assigned routes

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No locations scheduled for this day"
- Go to Delivery Stops and assign days to your stops
- Make sure the day buttons are highlighted (selected)

### Routes not showing on map
- Make sure locations have been geocoded
- Try refreshing the page
- Check that routes have been generated for the selected day

### Driver can't see their route
- Make sure the route is "Published" (not just "Assigned")
- Verify the route is for today's day of week
- Check that the driver is assigned to the route

### Clock in/out not working
- Driver must be within the geofenced radius of a work location
- Check that Work Locations are configured with correct addresses
- Verify GPS is enabled on the driver's device
