# Grizzly Mats Driver Management App

## Overview
A mobile-optimized web application for managing mat delivery driver schedules, GPS-verified time tracking, and route optimization. Built with an Apple-inspired design aesthetic.

## Demo Credentials
- **Admin**: username: `admin`, password: `admin123`
- **Driver**: username: `driver1`, password: `driver123`

## Project Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **Framework**: React with Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Apple-inspired design system
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Shadcn/UI primitives

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
- **API**: RESTful API with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **File Upload**: Multer for CSV file handling
- **CSV Parsing**: csv-parse library

### Database Schema
- `users` - Drivers and administrators
- `locations` - Delivery stop locations (from CSV uploads)
- `routes` - Assigned routes with stops in JSON format
- `time_entries` - Clock in/out records with GPS coordinates
- `work_locations` - Geofenced locations for GPS verification

## Key Features

### Admin Dashboard
1. **Delivery Stops Management**
   - CSV upload for delivery locations with automatic geocoding
   - Multi-day scheduling per location (assign Mon-Sun toggles)
   - Locations can be assigned to multiple days (e.g., Tuesday AND Friday)
   - Search and filter delivery stops

2. **Route Management**
   - Auto-generate optimized routes per day using K-means clustering + nearest-neighbor algorithm
   - Google Routes API integration for optimal waypoint ordering
   - **Routes automatically start and end at the Warehouse** (583 Frederick Road, Catonsville, MD 21228)
   - **Date-specific scheduling**: Routes are generated for specific dates (not recurring weekly)
   - Generate Routes dialog shows next 14 days with actual dates (e.g., "Monday - Jan 20")
   - Interactive Map View with colored markers per route
   - Move stops up/down within a route or reassign to different drivers
   - Assign drivers to routes
   - Publish routes for drivers to see
   - Delete routes when needed

3. **Calendar View**
   - Weekly view (default) showing routes per driver per day
   - Monthly view with route summaries per day
   - **Routes appear only on their specific scheduled date** (not every occurrence of that day)
   - Color-coded routes by driver
   - Navigation controls (back, forward, today)

4. **Driver Management**
   - Add/remove drivers and admins
   - View all team members

5. **Time Tracking**
   - View all clock in/out entries
   - Export to CSV for payroll

6. **Work Locations**
   - Configure geofenced locations with auto-geocoding from address
   - Set GPS verification radius (default 100m)

### Driver Mobile View
1. **Schedule**
   - View assigned route for the day
   - Numbered stop list with customer info
   - One-tap Google Maps navigation

2. **Time Clock**
   - GPS-verified clock in/out
   - Must be within geofenced work location
   - Visual status indicators

3. **Profile**
   - View account info
   - Log out
